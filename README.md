# clicky-game

## Overview
This was an assignment to show initial comprehension with REACT using create-react-app.  Components (REACT), Bootstrap and CSS styling were also used.

## How it works
User clicks on an image and then the images are shuffled.  The purpose of the game is to not click the same image twice.  A score and top score are shown at the top.  If the users current score is higher than the top score when there is a loss it will replace the top score.  If the score reaches 12, the game is won and the Top Score will not change as that score cannot be beaten.
